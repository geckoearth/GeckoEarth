Gecko Finance is a deflationary crypto currency finance coin designed to become a valuable asset for token holders.

The Gecko Finance token works in conjunction with the Decentralized Financial Applications we are building. The DeFi applications are designed to generate income that is then re-invested back into the Gecko Coin to increase the value of GECKO. The relationship of $GECKO is symbiotic which means that it is not a governance token but rather a funding mechanism for both the application design and development of applications that use $GECKO as a utility and a downstream beneficiary of the profits applications generate.
